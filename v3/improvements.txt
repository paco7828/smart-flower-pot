Split functionality:
     - 1 portable "transmitter":
         - PCB includes soil moisture and all other sensors
     - 1 "receiver":
         - Uses ESP-NOW for communication with the transmitter, water pump + water level container connected

    - Summary:
         - transmitter sends the data wirelessly, powered via battery + charged via solar panel
         - receiver handles watering and processes data into home assistant via MQTT, powered via cable, has a TFT screen to show the received data

Components:
     - Stronger water pump -> R385:
         - Install step up converter (3.7V battery to 9V for the pump)
         - Converter circuit is only activated when watering should happen (ESP32 GPIO switches circuit)

     - Add buzzer, for "transmitter" & "receiver", both will beep every 30 minutes when water container is running low
