Functionality:
    -Portable & hand sized
    -Remove water level sensor due to unnecessarity
    -Add buzzer -> beeps when watering needed (soil moisture low)

Optional:
    -capacitive water presence sensor -> TTP223 + single insulated wire (wire in water -> water present)

PCB:
     - Change 1k resistors' size from 0805 to 0402
     - Change step up converter circuit to MT3608
     - Change leds' size from 0805 to 0402
     - Change SS14 schottky diodes to ->  1N5819HW-7-F
     - Change LDR to TEMT6000 (with 10k resistor)
     - Change 10k resistor's size from 0805 to 0402
     - Change DHT22 to -> DS18B20+
     - Change JST connector:
         - B2B-XH-A -> B2B-ZR + JT-A1250H-2P-300 
     - Soil moisture sensor goes directly on board
