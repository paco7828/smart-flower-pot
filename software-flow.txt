Power:
	Solar panel outside -> lifepo battery charger -> lifepo battery (3.2V) -> boost converter (stable 3.3V) -> ESP32

Software flow:

	ESP32 wakes up from light sleep every 30 seconds and reads sensors -> displays humidity, temperature, soil moisture, sunlight, water container level

	RGB led:
		-if low moisture -> blinks in red
		-if temp too high -> glows in red
		-if no sunlight -> glows in blue
        -if moisture + temp OK + sunlight present -> glows in green

	LDR:
		-sunlight detected -> enable screen backlight
		-no sunlight detected -> disable screen backlight

	Water level sensor:
		-water level below 20% -> sends notification through home assistant

	Soil moisture sensor:
		-if soil moisture goes below X percent -> water pump gets activated for x seconds
